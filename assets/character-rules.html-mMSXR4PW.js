Your source of power is real, is determined by your class and subclass, and cannot be reflavoured. Any character option, including subclass, feats, or multiclassing, that causes a character to combine multiple different sources of power - eg Paladin + Warlock - needs case-by-case approval and has roleplaying consequences.</p><p>The approximate groupings of power sources are: Arcane, Divine, Martial, Primal, Psionic, Shadow and Elemental. Each subclass should be able to fit into one of these groups, but I&#39;m not strictly assigning them upfront.</p><p>Characters with a god or patron (Clerics, Paladins, Warlocks, Zealot Barbarian, maybe others) has <em>responsibilities</em> to that god or patron. A god can withdraw a character&#39;s divine power in extreme situations, and a patron can pursue other punishments.</p><p>Psionics are illegal and persecuted in most parts of the world, as detailed in the <a href="../world/world-overview#history">world history</a>. As such, the Soulknife, Psi Warrior, and Aberrant Sorcerer come with complications. A psionic character would need a backstory to answer how they know such powers, and a plan on how to work happily with the party and avoid upsetting NPCs and getting killed by an angry mob.</p><p>Celestial Warlock is disallowed because it clashes with the &#39;mixed power source&#39; theme and I just can&#39;t reconcile it with the setting.</p><p>Clockwork Sorcerer works differently - there is no Plane of Law - but is permitted.</p><h2 id="bastions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bastions"><span>Bastions</span></a></h2><p>Bastions are a customisable stronghold or base of operations available for players and their party, from the new Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide.</p><p>The party will have at least one Bastion.</p><p>More Bastions may be permitted, either separate or merged together, depending on player interest and willingness to do the required homework.
