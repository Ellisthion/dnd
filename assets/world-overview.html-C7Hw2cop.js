Angels occasionally appear to act as more direct servants.</p><p>Most people in the world pray to multiple gods, depending on what they need, such as a prayer to Njord before a sea journey, or a prayer to Freya for a good harvest.</p><h2 id="history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#history"><span>History</span></a></h2><p>The temples teach a basic history that is widely known by everyone, from noble to peasant.</p><p>Thousands of years ago, the gods made the world, but then abandoned it. In the absence of gods, dragons ruled. Then came the illithids: terrifying brain-eating monsters known as mind flayers. With their psionic powers, the illithids psychically enslaved all the peoples of the world. All hope was lost, until the gods returned, with a gift: magic. Wielding the power of the gods, the slaves rose up against the illithids, destroying their empire, eradicating every last one, and burning their cities to ash.</p><p>Today, all surviving cultures are influenced by this shared trauma. Slavery is rare and widely condemned, as is any attempt to take away the free will of a person, particularly through magic. Psionic magic is illegal and persecuted, but dark cults still practice psionics in secret. In rural areas, accusations of psionic manipulations can turn into witch-hunts against guilty and innocent alike.</p><h2 id="major-factions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#major-factions"><span>Major Factions</span></a></h2><h3 id="bronston-forge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bronston-forge"><span>Bronston Forge</span></a></h3><p>In Bronston Forge, secrets are power. Queen Sorelia has unified the city with the nearby dark elves of Lucrezia, and her spymaster&#39;s resources are unmatched. The Temple of Freya under Lord Reginald is based here, as well as their military branch, the Order of the Sacred Spear.</p><p>Bronston Forge was recently devastated by war and a magical explosion that destroyed half the city, but has rebuilt from the ashes. In the heart of the city is New Tenateal, a massive gingerbread castle that serves as the city&#39;s mage guild.</p><p>Bronston Forge&#39;s population is mostly humans and dwarves, with halflings and elves also common.</p><h3 id="valengard" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#valengard"><span>Valengard</span></a></h3><p>In Valengard, military is power. General Nikonos lead both army and state, but it is an imperial republic - he is at the whim of a council of nobles. The Valengard army has carved out an empire, and Valengard is a centre of great architecture, arts, music, and fashion.</p><p>Valengard has recently had several substantial military defeats, causing tensions both with with other major city-states, and amongst the minor kingdoms that make up its empire.</p><p>Valengard&#39;s population is predominately humans, but have a wide mix of a variety of people from their broad empire.</p><h3 id="rochekell" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rochekell"><span>Rochekell</span></a></h3><p>In Rochekell, magic is power. A mageocracy ruled by four powerful spellcasters, Rochekell enjoys both widespread usage of magic, as well as some of the strictest laws around its use. Some usages of enchantment magic, such as charms and love potions, can carry sentences harsher than for murder.</p><p>Rochekell has recently had substantial political tension with its southern neighbour, Ravena, and it is believed that war is likely inevitable. Army recruitment has stepped up, and there&#39;s rumours of a forced levy. The Griffonwing, elite griffon riders, are a frequent sight patrolling the skies in tight formations.</p><p>Rochekell&#39;s population is mostly humans and high elves, but ocean traders and magical portals bring all sorts of esoteric people.</p><h3 id="ravena" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ravena"><span>Ravena</span></a></h3><p>In Ravena, engineering is power. With some of the greatest artificers in the world, Ravena&#39;s architecture and magitech are unmatched. Their fleet of flying skyships are the envy of the world.</p><p>Ravena&#39;s king was recently assassinated, right under the watch of the zealous royal guard, the Silver Wardens. The new king has claimed Rochekell is responsible for the assassination.</p><p>Raven&#39;s population is almost entirely humans, dwarves, and gnomes.</p><h2 id="lesser-factions-and-locations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lesser-factions-and-locations"><span>Lesser Factions and Locations</span></a></h2><h3 id="ember" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ember"><span>Ember</span></a></h3><p>A vassal kingdom of Valengard. Was ruled by human nobles who marginalised non-humans, but a recent uprising saw the humans deposed and much of the city burned. The fragile revolutionary government is struggling to keep order, and neighbouring minor kingdoms are flooded with refugees.</p><p>Before the revolution, Ember had a small human ruling class and a mostly non-human population, but now many humans have fled - and many who remain are desperately try to prove some elven or dwarven ancestry. Elves, dwarves, halflings make up most of the populace, but many have at least some human in their family tree.</p><h3 id="vildmark" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vildmark"><span>Vildmark</span></a></h3><p>A small town on the border of Rochekell and Ravena&#39;s territory. Small trader ships and fishing boats constantly fight off raids by local merfolk.</p><p>Vildmark recently suffered a magical accident, leaving the town&#39;s ocean cliffs infused with elemental air, creating a floating archipelago of tiny islands which are slowing being connected by rope bridges and chains.</p><h3 id="lucrezia" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lucrezia"><span>Lucrezia</span></a></h3><p>Deep in the Dark Forest is a reclusive city of drow (dark elves). Queen Sorelia of Bronston Forge is half-Lucrezian and has politically unified the city with Bronston Forge.</p><p>Lucrezia is entirely populated by drow, with the occasional half-drow.</p><h3 id="ylonen-clans" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ylonen-clans"><span>Ylönen Clans</span></a></h3><p>In the tundra north of Rochekell are a variety of clans known as the Ylönen. The most significant are the White Fox, Grey Raven, and Blue Roc tribes. They are constantly in a struggle against elements, and the giant monsters and dragons that live in the northern reaches of the world. Many of the Ylönen are renowned beastmasters, taming these monsters to fight alongside them.</p><p>The Ylönen culture is heavily influences by the traditions of the oni (goliaths), who channel the powers of their giant ancestors. Personal and family honour are extremely important. They are led by a samurai caste who are deemed favoured by the gods - anyone who channels Divine magic is considered blessed.</p><p>The Ylönen are a mix of humans, wood elves, dwarves, orcs, and goliaths.</p><h3 id="eastern-steppes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#eastern-steppes"><span>Eastern Steppes</span></a></h3><p>To the east past the mountains are endless grasslands, inhabited by nomadic tribes of wood elves, orcs, and goliaths.</p><h3 id="southern-deserts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#southern-deserts"><span>Southern Deserts</span></a></h3><p>Stories tell of deserts to the south, inhabited by dark elves.
