You&#39;re the one who gets to decide what they do, and why. I sometimes see people use &quot;It&#39;s what my character would do&quot; to excuse bad behaviour, but don&#39;t get it twisted: you created that character, you decide what they&#39;re like, and how they act. You have the power to create a character that your fellow party members are going to enjoy playing with.</p><p>â€” <a href="https://youtu.be/zeHzNBb-_8Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ginny Di</em></a></p></blockquote><p>Your character should:</p><ul><li>Have a reason to go adventuring, risking your life</li><li>Have a reason to stay with and work with the party</li><li>Have goals aligning with the fantasy world and D&amp;D progression</li><li>Not be a liability, in combat or outside it</li></ul><p>Your character&#39;s motivations don&#39;t have to be complex - it could be as simple as altruism, wealth, power, or duty. Or it can be deeper, but should still align with the overall campaign themes and be compatible with an adventuring life that extends into high-level play.</p><p>The tone is serious plot with just the right amount of silly. A light-hearted or comic relief character is okay - a joke character is not. Foolish decisions are fine, but pointless acts of randomness are not. If you&#39;re not sure about tone, watch <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> or <em>D&amp;D: Honour Among Thieves</em>.</p><p>Your character does <em>not</em> have to be a good person, or motivated by heroism. But they should be able to work alongside those who are. As DM, I will be making sure there are incentives for characters that aren&#39;t just in it to help people.</p><p>If you have a character inspired by an existing character in other fiction, remember to keep it as &quot;inspired&quot;, not &quot;copy&quot; - otherwise you aren&#39;t playing your own character, and will have preconceived notions about how the character &quot;should&quot; be.</p><p>There will be a &quot;Session 0&quot; where we will discuss expectations, characters, and so on. Pre-planning a character is fine, but I recommend waiting until Session 0 to finalise how your character will fit into the game and world.</p>',9)),a("p",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("For rules information, see ")),o(i,{to:"/campaign-open-skies/character-creation.html"},{default:n(()=>e[0]||(e[0]=[t("Character Creation")])),_:1}),e[2]||(e[2]=t("."))]),e[7]||(e[7]=r('<h2 id="campaign-theme" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#campaign-theme"><span>Campaign Theme</span></a></h2><p>The major themes of the campaign are:</p><ul><li>Magic and power - who has it, where does it come from?</li><li>History - uncover the mysteries of the past</li><li>Politics - amongst gods, city-states, secretive underworld figures, and more</li><li>Freedom - as players, you are empowered to proactively explore the world</li></ul><p>There will be a central narrative as well as countless side stories.
