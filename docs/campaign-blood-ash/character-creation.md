# Character Creation

We will create characters together, in the first session. In this session, we will also go over everything about the campaign upfront, including the player expectations, campaign overview and themes, characters, and rules.

If you want to have know more upfront, read on.
## The Golden Rule
Talk to your DM.

If you have an idea or concern, I can't help if I don't know.

I am willing to bend the rules if you have a good character concept that doesn't quite fit with the rules as written.
## Rules
We will be using the 2024 Player's Handbook.

Most options are allowed, with a couple of exceptions, and a couple of caveats.
## Species / Race
The city you will be starting in, [Ember](../world/world-overview.md), is currently persecuting Humans. You may select the Human species, but _must_ describe your character as being Half-Elf, Half-Dwarf, or some other mix... or disguised as such.

Dragonborn are not permitted, because _you know what you did_.

Goliaths and Orcs are predominantly from the Northern Tribes, Eastern Steppes, and the Bronze Ridge mountains - if you're not from there, your backstory should explain why. Drow (Dark Elves) must be from Lucrezia or the Southern Deserts.
## Class
Psionic magic is illegal and persecuted in most parts of the world (see [World History](../world/world-overview.md#history)). The three Psionic character options - Soulknife, Psi Warrior, and Aberrant Sorcerer - are permitted, but you need to be able to explain why you're not getting immediately lynched, and be prepared to deal with the consequences.

Characters empowered by gods - Cleric, Paladin, and Zealot Barbarian - must select a specific Norse god.

Celestial Warlock is not permitted, because it causes problems with certain story elements.
