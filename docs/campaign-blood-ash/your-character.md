# Your Character

Your character should:
* Have a reason to go adventuring, risking your life
* Have a reason to stay with and work with the party
* Have goals aligning with the fantasy world

Your character's motivations don't have to be complex - it could be as simple as altruism, wealth, power, or duty. Or it can be deeper, but should still align with the overall campaign themes and be compatible with an adventuring life. Your character does *not* have to be a good person, or motivated by heroism.
## Campaign Theme
The major themes of the campaign are::
* Consequences - your actions shape the world
* Aftermath - there were wars, revolutions, and more... but what happens next?
* Politics - large city-states and smaller kingdoms watch the changing world nervously

Valengard's empire of smaller kingdoms is at the heart of this campaign. The empire is under both external pressure from Bronston Forge and Ravena, and internal pressure as minor kingdoms experience revolutions, unrest, and refugee crises.
## Campaign Start
The beginning of the campaign will be in and around the city of [Ember](../world/world-overview.md#ember), a city that has experienced a violent revolution that deposed the ruling humans.

Chronologically, this campaign starts just _before_ the Midsummer Feast session in Vildmark.

Player characters must:
* Have a reason to be in Ember
* Be able to move around in a city that is currently persecuting humans and ex-nobles
* *Not* be loyal to either Rochekell or Ravena, because if you were, you wouldn't be in Ember right now

This can be as simple as "I grew up in Ember", but if you're from further afield, it may need more thought. It's important that you're not a pure human.

If you've been in Ember for a while, think about how your life was before the revolution, and what you did during the revolution.
