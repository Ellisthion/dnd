# Character Creation

Characters concepts should be run by the DM, particularly when more complex mechanically, or when intertwined with the world and lore.
## The Golden Rule
Talk to your DM.

If you have an idea or concern, I can't help if I don't know.

I am willing to bend the rules if you have a good character concept that doesn't quite fit with the rules as written.

In addition, don't get too stressed about whether a particular option is underpowered, for example concerns about Dance vs Glamour Bard power level. Pick the right vibe and we'll make it work.
## Rules
The only permitted source at this time is the 2024 Player's Handbook.

Almost all options are allowed, but some may come with roleplaying complications and may need some discussion.

Multiclassing requires DM approval. Feats are fine, but please let me know what you pick.
## Attributes
Attributes can be:
* Standard array
* Points buy
* Rolled with physical dice during session 0

The attribute bonuses attached to Backgrounds may be adjusted on a case-by-case basis. Talk to me if you have an idea that doesn't fit properly with the published Backgrounds.
## Species / Races
* Very rare: Aasimar, Tiefling
* Must be from certain geographical areas: Drow, Goliath, Orc
* Discouraged due to extreme rarity: Dragonborn

Goliaths and Orcs are predominantly from the Northern Tribes, Eastern Steppes, and the Bronze Ridge mountains - if you're not from there, your backstory should explain why. Drow (Dark Elves) must be from Lucrezia or the Southern Deserts. Dragonborn are _inconvenient_ story-wise and I'd prefer if nobody played them.
## Classes
- **Barbarian**: All okay but Zealot *must* choose a deity
- **Bard**: All okay
- **Cleric**: All okay
- **Druid**: All okay
- **Fighter**: Psi Warrior needs approval (psionics are illegal)
- **Monk**: All okay
- **Paladin**: All okay, but Paladins *must* choose a deity
- **Ranger**: All okay
- **Rogue**: Soulknife needs approval (psionics are illegal)
- **Sorcerer**: Aberrant needs approval (psionics are illegal)
- **Warlock**: Celestial banned
- **Wizard**: All okay

A major theme of this campaign is power, and where it comes from. Your source of power is real, is determined by your class and subclass, and cannot be reflavoured. Any character option, including subclass, feats, or multiclassing, that causes a character to combine multiple different sources of power - eg Paladin + Warlock - needs case-by-case approval and has roleplaying consequences.

The approximate groupings of power sources are: Arcane, Divine, Martial, Primal, Psionic, Shadow and Elemental. Each subclass should be able to fit into one of these groups, but I'm not strictly assigning them upfront.

Characters with a god or patron (Clerics, Paladins, Warlocks, Zealot Barbarian, maybe others) has *responsibilities* to that god or patron. A god can withdraw a character's divine power in extreme situations, and a patron can pursue other punishments.

Psionics are illegal and persecuted in most parts of the world. As such, the Soulknife, Psi Warrior, and Aberrant Sorcerer come with complications. Aberrant Sorcerer in particular is very risky.

Celestial Warlock is banned because it clashes with the 'mixed power source' theme and I just can't reconcile it with the setting.

Clockwork Sorcerer works differently - there is no Plane of Law - but is permitted.
## Bastions
The party will have at least one Bastion. More may be permitted, either separate or merged together, depending on player interest and willingness to do the required homework. To be blunt: if you're not willing to read the rules, crack out an Excel sheet, and play Stardew Valley, then this is not for you.
