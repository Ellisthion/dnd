# Your Character

>In the end, this is a character, not a person. You're the one who gets to decide what they do, and why. I sometimes see people use "It's what my character would do" to excuse bad behaviour, but don't get it twisted: you created that character, you decide what they're like, and how they act. You have the power to create a character that your fellow party members are going to enjoy playing with.

Your character should:
* Have a reason to go adventuring, risking your life
* Have a reason to stay with and work with the party
* Have goals aligning with the fantasy world and D&D progression
* Not be a liability, in combat or outside it

Your character's motivations don't have to be complex - it could be as simple as altruism, wealth, power, or duty. Or it can be deeper, but should still align with the overall campaign themes and be compatible with an adventuring life that extends into high-level play.

The tone is serious plot with just the right amount of silly. A light-hearted or comic relief character is okay - a joke character is not. If you're not sure about tone, watch *Guardians of the Galaxy* or *D&D: Honour Among Thieves*.

## Campaign Start
The beginning of the campaign will be in and around the city of Rochekell. For more information about the world, see [[Player World Overview]].

Player characters must:
* Have a reason to be in Rochekell
* Be okay working with Rochekell's army
* Be comfortable siding with Rochekell in a conflict against Ravena

This can be as simple as "I grew up in Rochekell", but if you're from further afield, it may need more thought. It's important that you are _not_ aligned with Ravena.

Maybe it's duty. Maybe it's money. Maybe one of your friends is doing it and peer pressure is fun. Maybe you were in prison, but negotiated freedom that involves working for the Rochekell army for a time.
