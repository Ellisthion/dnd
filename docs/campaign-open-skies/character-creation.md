# Character Creation

Please run character concepts by the DM, particularly when more complex mechanically, or when intertwined with the world and lore.

There will be a "Session 0" where we will discuss everything about the campaign upfront, including the player expectations, campaign overview and themes, characters, and rules. I recommend holding off finalising your character until we've had that session.
## The Golden Rule
Talk to your DM.

If you have an idea or concern, I can't help if I don't know.

I am willing to bend the rules if you have a good character concept that doesn't quite fit with the rules as written.
## Rules
The only permitted source at this time is the 2024 Player's Handbook.

Almost all options are allowed, but some may come with roleplaying complications and may need some discussion. The only completely disallowed options are Celestial Warlock and Dragonborn.

Multiclassing requires DM approval. Feats are fine, but please let me know what you pick.

Characters will start at level 1.
## Attributes
Attributes can be:
* Standard array
* Points buy
* Rolled with physical dice during session 0

The attribute bonuses attached to Backgrounds may be adjusted on a case-by-case basis. Talk to me if you have an idea that doesn't fit properly with the published Backgrounds.
## Species / Races
* Very rare: Aasimar, Tiefling
* Must be from certain geographical areas: Drow, Goliath, Orc
* Not allowed: Dragonborn

Goliaths and Orcs are predominantly from the Northern Tribes, Eastern Steppes, and the Bronze Ridge mountains - if you're not from there, your backstory should explain why. Drow (Dark Elves) must be from Lucrezia or the Southern Deserts.

Dragonborn aren't allowed because some events in the Heart of the Sea Campaign made me dramatically rethink how I wanted to include Dragonborn in the world, and the narrative around that is worth more to me than allowing them as a playable race. At time of campaign start, Dragonborn are unheard of, they don't exist.
## Classes
- **Barbarian**: All okay but Zealot *must* choose a deity
- **Bard**: All okay
- **Cleric**: All okay
- **Druid**: All okay
- **Fighter**: Psi Warrior needs approval (psionics are illegal)
- **Monk**: All okay
- **Paladin**: All okay, but Paladins *must* choose a deity
- **Ranger**: All okay
- **Rogue**: Soulknife needs approval (psionics are illegal)
- **Sorcerer**: Aberrant needs approval (psionics are illegal)
- **Warlock**: Celestial is not allowed
- **Wizard**: All okay

A major theme of this campaign is power, and where it comes from. Your source of power is real, is determined by your class and subclass, and cannot be reflavoured. Any character option, including subclass, feats, or multiclassing, that causes a character to combine multiple different sources of power - eg Paladin + Warlock - needs case-by-case approval and has roleplaying consequences.

The approximate groupings of power sources are: Arcane, Divine, Martial, Primal, Psionic, Shadow and Elemental. Each subclass should be able to fit into one of these groups, but I'm not strictly assigning them upfront.

Characters with a god or patron (Clerics, Paladins, Warlocks, Zealot Barbarian, maybe others) has *responsibilities* to that god or patron. A god can withdraw a character's divine power in extreme situations, and a patron can pursue other punishments.

Psionics are illegal and persecuted in most parts of the world, as detailed in the [World History](../world/world-overview.md#history). As such, the Soulknife, Psi Warrior, and Aberrant Sorcerer come with complications. A psionic character would need a backstory to answer how they know such powers, and a plan on how to work happily with the party and avoid upsetting NPCs and getting killed by an angry mob.

Celestial Warlock is disallowed because it clashes with the 'mixed power source' theme and I just can't reconcile it with the setting.

Clockwork Sorcerer works differently - there is no Plane of Law - but is permitted.
## Bastions
Bastions are a customisable stronghold or base of operations available for players and their party, from the new Dungeon Master's Guide.

The party will have at least one Bastion.

More Bastions may be permitted, either separate or merged together, depending on player interest and willingness to do the required homework. This option is intended for players who enjoy both Excel and Stardew Valley.
