# Your Character

>In the end, this is a character, not a person. You're the one who gets to decide what they do, and why. I sometimes see people use "It's what my character would do" to excuse bad behaviour, but don't get it twisted: you created that character, you decide what they're like, and how they act. You have the power to create a character that your fellow party members are going to enjoy playing with.

>â€” [*Ginny Di*](https://youtu.be/zeHzNBb-_8Y)

Your character should:
* Have a reason to go adventuring, risking your life
* Have a reason to stay with and work with the party
* Have goals aligning with the fantasy world and D&D progression
* Not be a liability, in combat or outside it

Your character's motivations don't have to be complex - it could be as simple as altruism, wealth, power, or duty. Or it can be deeper, but should still align with the overall campaign themes and be compatible with an adventuring life that extends into high-level play.

The tone is serious plot with just the right amount of silly. A light-hearted or comic relief character is okay - a joke character is not. Foolish decisions are fine, but pointless acts of randomness are not. If you're not sure about tone, watch *Guardians of the Galaxy* or *D&D: Honour Among Thieves*.

Your character does *not* have to be a good person, or motivated by heroism. But they should be able to work alongside those who are. As DM, I will be making sure there are incentives for characters that aren't just in it to help people.

If you have a character inspired by an existing character in other fiction, remember to keep it as "inspired", not "copy" - otherwise you aren't playing your own character, and will have preconceived notions about how the character "should" be.

There will be a "Session 0" where we will discuss expectations, characters, and so on. Pre-planning a character is fine, but I recommend waiting until Session 0 to finalise how your character will fit into the game and world.

## Campaign Theme
The major themes of the campaign are:
* Magic and power - who has it, where does it come from?
* History - uncover the mysteries of the past
* Politics - amongst gods, city-states, secretive underworld figures, and more
* Freedom - as players, you are empowered to proactively explore the world

There will be a central narrative as well as countless side stories. You will be encouraged to explore and engage in the parts of the story and world that interest you.

Combat is intended to challenging. Make sure your character can contribute to combat in a meaningful way.

Unlike the Bronston Forge Campaign, there will _not_ be an emphasis on secrets and conflict between players characters. Hostile or disruptive actions towards other player characters will only be allowed if you can convince both the DM and the other players involved why such actions are beneficial to the game and everyone's enjoyment of it.

## Campaign Start
The beginning of the campaign will be in and around the city of Rochekell. For more information about the world, see [World Overview](../world/world-overview.md).

Player characters must:
* Have a reason to be in Rochekell
* Be okay working with Rochekell's army
* Be comfortable siding with Rochekell in a conflict against Ravena

This can be as simple as "I grew up in Rochekell", but if you're from further afield, it may need more thought. It's important that you are _not_ aligned with Ravena.

Maybe it's duty. Maybe it's money. Maybe one of your friends is doing it and peer pressure is fun. Maybe it's to get the eye of someone important in Rochekell. Maybe you were in prison, but negotiated freedom that involves working for the Rochekell army for a time.
