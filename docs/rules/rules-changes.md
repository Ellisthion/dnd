# Rules Changes
This page covers specific rules changes. Any rules and restrictions on character creation is instead covered in [Character Creation](../characters/character-rules.md).

## Druid Wild Shape
Wild Shape is extended to allow you to turn into certain animal-like non-Beasts, such as Giant Eagles and Hippogryphs. As a rule of thumb, if a creature doesn't have any special magical abilities, it's probably okay - for example: Pegasus is fine, but Unicorn is not.

As a reminder, dinosaurs do not exist in this world, so cannot be used as Wild Shape forms.
## Spells
The following spells are changed:
* Conjure Minor Elementals - (TBD) scaling reduced to 1d8 for each two spell levels above 4
* Conjure Woodland Beings - (TBD) add "on your turn" restriction to after "Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see"
* Forbiddance - requires caster to walk around the target area
* Glyph of Warding - you can't use this to break Concentration rules
* Reincarnation - much more exciting species table
* Wish - has no basic or safe uses, only use is the "Reshape Reality" option, but stress backlash and other consequences are up to the DM's discretion and are not guaranteed
## Darkvision
In addition to its normal effects, Darkvision is slightly coloured by temperature. Hot and cold objects and creatures appear differently. This is intended to mimic the Infravision ability which appeared in older D&D versions, but is always intended to work _at least_ as well as 5E Darkvision.

Mostly this is just a cute stylistic thing, but it has practical uses: for example, an old D&D novel had Dark Elves signal to each other using heated metal plates.
