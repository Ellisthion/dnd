# Rules Changes

::: info
This page covers specific rules changes. Any rules or restrictions on character creation is instead covered in [Character Creation (Open Skies)](../campaign-open-skies/character-creation.md) and [Character Creation (Blood & Ash)](../campaign-blood-ash/character-creation.md).
:::

## Fighting Styles
* Great Weapon Fighting - the minimum die roll becomes half the die size. For example, a greatsword (2d6) can treat a 1 or 2 as a 3; a greataxe (1d12) can treat a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as a 6. This applies to all additional dice that are part of the attack, with dice of different sizes having their own respective minimums.

## Feats
* Durable - when you roll a Hit Point Die to recover hit points using the Speedy Recovery feature, add your Constitution modifier.

## Druid
### Wild Shape
Wild Shape is extended to allow you to turn into certain animal-like non-Beasts, such as Giant Eagles and Hippogryphs. As a rule of thumb, if a creature doesn't have any special magical abilities, it's probably okay - for example: Pegasus is fine, but Unicorn is not.

As a reminder, dinosaurs do not exist in this world, so cannot be used as Wild Shape forms.

## Sorcerer
### Wild Magic
Replace: "you can roll 1d20 immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot", with "you must roll 1d20 immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot". You chose a cool subclass, don't be a pansy.

## Spells
The following spells are changed:
* Forbiddance - requires caster to walk around the target area
* Glyph of Warding - you can't use this to break Concentration rules
* Reincarnation - much more exciting species table
* Wish - has no basic or safe uses, only use is the "Reshape Reality" option, but stress backlash and other consequences are up to the DM's discretion and are not guaranteed

Watch list: will be changed if they prove problematic:
* "Conjure" spells, eg Conjure Minor Elementals - note that the official errata reduces the scaling of Conjure Minor Elementals, Conjure Elementals, and Conjure Fey to one die per level
* Emanations, eg Conjure Woodland Beings and Spirit Guardians - don't try to play silly games and we won't have a problem

## Miscellaneous
* Stunned condition - undecided if this should change. The 2024 Stunned rules do not set the target's Speed to 0, and while this is intended, it's not necessarily a good change.&nbsp;<InfoIcon>Stunning Strike and Power Word Stun both reduce the target's Speed if they resist the Stun. This suggests the authors of those features were not aware that the Stunned condition was being changed.</InfoIcon>
* You may draw or stow items before and after doing any attack, action, or bonus action.&nbsp;<InfoIcon>Strictly following draw/stow rules leads to stupid outcomes like people dropping weapons on the floor.</InfoIcon>

## Minions
In some fights, Minions will be used, using the rules from [Flee Mortals!](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/en-au/collections/flee-mortals-the-mcdm-monster-book).

Adjustments:
* Damage from the Cleave Weapon Mastery counts as a hit against a Minion
* Damage from the Graze Weapon Mastery counts as a hit against a Minion&nbsp;<InfoIcon>An attack with Graze is guaranteed to kill a Minion even if it misses.</InfoIcon>
* Magic Missile: Each missile counts as a hit against a Minion&nbsp;<InfoIcon>Each missile is a guaranteed Minion kill. This is a change to the previous ruling.</InfoIcon> 

## Darkvision
In addition to its normal effects, Darkvision is slightly coloured by temperature. Hot and cold objects and creatures appear differently. This is intended to mimic the Infravision ability which appeared in older D&D versions, but is always intended to work _at least_ as well as 5E Darkvision.

Mostly this is just a cute stylistic thing, but it has practical uses: for example, an old D&D novel had Dark Elves signal to each other using heated metal plates.
