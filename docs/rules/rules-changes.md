# Rules Changes

::: info
This page covers specific rules changes. Any rules or restrictions on character creation is instead covered in [Character Creation (Open Skies)](../campaign-open-skies/character-creation.md) and [Character Creation (Blood & Ash)](../campaign-blood-ash/character-creation.md).

## Druid Wild Shape
Wild Shape is extended to allow you to turn into certain animal-like non-Beasts, such as Giant Eagles and Hippogryphs. As a rule of thumb, if a creature doesn't have any special magical abilities, it's probably okay - for example: Pegasus is fine, but Unicorn is not.

As a reminder, dinosaurs do not exist in this world, so cannot be used as Wild Shape forms.

## Spells
The following spells are changed:
* Forbiddance - requires caster to walk around the target area
* Glyph of Warding - you can't use this to break Concentration rules
* Reincarnation - much more exciting species table
* Wish - has no basic or safe uses, only use is the "Reshape Reality" option, but stress backlash and other consequences are up to the DM's discretion and are not guaranteed

Watch list: will be changed if they prove problematic:
* "Conjure" spells, eg Conjure Minor Elementals - note that the official errata reduces the scaling of Conjure Minor Elementals, Conjure Elementals, and Conjure Fey to one die per level
* Emanations, eg Conjure Woodland Beings and Spirit Guardians - don't try to play silly games and we won't have a problem

## Darkvision
In addition to its normal effects, Darkvision is slightly coloured by temperature. Hot and cold objects and creatures appear differently. This is intended to mimic the Infravision ability which appeared in older D&D versions, but is always intended to work _at least_ as well as 5E Darkvision.

Mostly this is just a cute stylistic thing, but it has practical uses: for example, an old D&D novel had Dark Elves signal to each other using heated metal plates.
